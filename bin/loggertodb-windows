"""Executable script for pyinstaller.

Normally we shouldn't need this script. "pip install loggertodb"
installs a "loggertodb" script which has been created because of the
"entry_points" argument  to setuptools.setup(). However, pyinstaller,
which we use to create a single-file loggertodb.exe on windows, does not
support "entry_points", so we add this script which is more or less
identical to the one created by setuptools.
